# uci-scheduler
UCI Scheduling app using openAI's embed API for natural language search and ICSSC's PeterPortal API for UCI information.

inspired by Zot4Plan and deezy#2930's zotsearch.

this was a nice project to work on to solidify CRUD topics, backend work with express routing, as well as node.js fetch API calls and working more with react routing and states!
